B2M	B2M	P61769	32	3E-05	3.69	21	9606.ENSP00000452780	119	beta-2-microglobulin	 Component of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Involved in the presentation of peptide antigens to the immune system (By similarity)	
GUCA2B	GUCA2B	Q16661	107	0.01319	3.75	3	9606.ENSP00000361662	112	guanylate cyclase activator 2B (uroguanylin)	 Endogenous activator of intestinal guanylate cyclase. It stimulates this enzyme through the same receptor binding region as the heat-stable enterotoxins. May be a potent physiological regulator of intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport. May be an autocrine/paracrine regulator of intestinal salt and water transport	
APOA1	APOA1	P02647	26	3E-05	3.89	26	9606.ENSP00000236850	267	apolipoprotein A-I	 Participates in the reverse transport of cholesterol from tissues to the liver for excretion by promoting cholesterol efflux from tissues and by acting as a cofactor for the lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). As part of the SPAP complex, activates spermatozoa motility	
APOA4	APOA4	P06727	30	3E-05	4.19	39	9606.ENSP00000350425	396	apolipoprotein A-IV	 May have a role in chylomicrons and VLDL secretion and catabolism. Required for efficient activation of lipoprotein lipase by ApoC-II	 potent activator of LCAT. Apoa-IV is a major component of HDL and chylomicrons

IGFBP6	IGFBP6	P24592	40	3E-05	5.08	3	9606.ENSP00000301464	240	insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6	 IGF-binding proteins prolong the half-life of the IGFs and have been shown to either inhibit or stimulate the growth promoting effects of the IGFs on cell culture. They alter the interaction of IGFs with their cell surface receptors	
CFD	CFD	P00746	10	3E-05	5.44	14	9606.ENSP00000332139	253	complement factor D (adipsin)	 Factor D cleaves factor B when the latter is complexed with factor C3b, activating the C3bbb complex, which then becomes the C3 convertase of the alternate pathway. Its function is homologous to that of C1s in the classical pathway
